- 👋 Hi, I’m @anthonydoes
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a fullstack software developer..being self-taught, I was able to land my first Jr FE role last year, but was cut short due to the pandemic..
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all things JS - React, NodeJS, Gatsby..just trying to get my feet wet in everything, but I'm really trying to get a better handle of server-side programming with NodeJS first, and then I would like to eventually pick up some Ruby or PHP..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can help out with..
- 📫 How to reach me ... anthonydoesdev@gmail.com
